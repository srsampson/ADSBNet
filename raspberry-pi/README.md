##### Raspberry PI Version
Unfortunately Oracle Java 8 is the latest version available for the ARM 32-bit CPU.

So I added this version for running it on a Raspberry Pi and doing the multicast from there.

The GUI shows the status of your Unicast shares, and the Basestation Port data. However the display is optional, by
configuring the ```gui.enable``` setting in ```adsnet.config```.
